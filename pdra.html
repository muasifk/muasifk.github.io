      <h1>Context-Recognition in Crowd Monitoring using Crowdsourced Data</h1>
      <p>
      
       This research aims to develop a highly efficient intelligent system that uses UAVs to collect live footages of crowded scenes, perform fast analysis of the crowd scene, and produce real-time inference using pre-trained DL models stored at the UAV. In addition, data from multi-modal sources such as social media (YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter etc.) and events venues (airports, sports stadiums, exhibitions) is collected to perform crowd context recognition.

      <h2>Project Details</h2>
      <p>
          
      Understanding of crowd dynamics in mass gatherings of people such as mega sports events, religious gatherings, cultural events, and natural disasters is of great importance for crowd safety and risk analysis. In particular, real-time crowd monitoring can help event organizers and law enforcement agencies to minimize the risks of undesirable incidents and instantly manage the crowds to ensure safety, save human lives, protect properties, preserve the environment, and provide a more pleasant experience to event attendees.
          
      Monitoring crowds using images and videos is a complex task and requires optimal representation of features to train the ML model. The traditional approaches usually employ appearance and motion to extract handcrafted features. Such methods usually produce satisfactory results in simple scenarios, but fail to perform in highly complex and dynamic scenes. Moreover, these methods cannot be used for more complex crowd monitoring tasks such as context recognition and behavior analysis.
          
      DL techniques can provide high prediction accuracy however, they usually incur high time complexity. Recent advancements in DL allows to reduce the time complexity while retaining a good prediction accuracy. Example of some techniques for CNN are advanced parameter pruning and sharing and transferred convolutional filters.
          
      In this research, we aim to develop an efficient UAV-based crowd monitoring system that include sophisticated features such as context recognition and behavior analysis of people in dense crowds using images/videos collected from UAVs, and multi-modal data sources such as social media and check in data from airports, stadiums and other venues.
        
      There are several associated challenges that shall be addressed in this research.
